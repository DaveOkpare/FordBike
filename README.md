# Ford GoBike System Data Analysis
## by David Okpare


## Dataset

> Ford GoBike System Dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The rides details are collected for the month of February 2019 across 329 stations. This dataset contains 183,143 rides information which features the following variables: duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip. Thus, analysis was performed using these variables.


## Summary of Findings

1. Univariate exploration: Majority of rides happen between 7am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm. These rides could explain the nature of the client's careers. The majority of clients are Subscribers and Males. 

2. Bivariate exploration: There is a decline in usage between 10:00 and 15:00 among Subscribers. Around the same time there's a steady and growing amount rides among Customers. Also, there are no rides shared among Customers. Ride Share for All Trips only happened among Subscribers.

3. Multivariate exploration: There's a cluster of duration per distance among Subscribers. This could mean that Subscribers follow similar routes and speed. While there's more variation among Customers. And Non Bike Share for All Trip Rides take longer in duration than Bike Share for All Trip Rides.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The focus will be on the differences between rides taking by Subscribers and rides taken by Customers. The distances users cover, the schedule (timings) they adopt, and whether or not they share bikes.
